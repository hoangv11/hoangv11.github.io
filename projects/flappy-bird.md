Flappy Bird Clone

This project is a clone of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, developed for me to gain experience with Unity and C#. The game features some simple features that resemble those of the original flappy bird game. Here are some of the features:

- Smooth and Responsive Controls: The bird's movement is controlled by tapping the screen or clicking the mouse, providing a smooth and responsive gaming experience.
- Procedurally Generated Obstacles: Pipes are generated at random and different positions
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, rewarding them for successfully passing through pipes.
- Retro Graphics: The visual style mimics the original Flappy Bird, with pixelated graphics and a simple, colorful aesthetic.
- Unity and C# Implementation: The project was built using Unity, a powerful game development platform, and C#, a versatile programming language. It showcases various Unity features such as physics, collision detection, and 
  sprite animation.

Here is an image showing some of the physics in Unity:
